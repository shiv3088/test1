          <h2>Words From <span>CEO</span> <small>Tanya Chaddha</small></h2>
          <p>Brainchild of Tanya Chaddha, a former Flight Attendant in Messa Group of Airlines, Travelopick has quickly taken quite a soar within a year of its launch. Tanya&lsquo;s dream of raising an online portal that can facilitate customized travel deals & packages for both planned as well as last minute trips was conceived way back when she was still flying in & from Charlotte for domestic routes. Her free spirit and keenness to discover new places makes her understand the true needs of an explorer who is planning on a trip. This is also one of the vision pillars and an absolute reason why Travelopick as a company, as a brand stands tall and different from any other OTPs, which are even much older than Travelopickitself.</p>
          <p>To serve its growing customers the best, Travelopick has a wide online presence both in the form of a well-built website and a mobile app.</p>
