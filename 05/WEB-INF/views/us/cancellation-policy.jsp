		 <p>Most of  the flight tickets, accommodations (hotels etc.), rental cars  (pre-paid), vacation packages and the service fees that is levied on  these products and services are non-refundable after 24 hours of  making the booking. All cancellation requests are to be made over the  phone only. Cancellation and refund requests are accepted only under  the following circumstances: </p>
<ul>
  <li>
     When  	cancellation and refund is possible according to the fare rules 
  </li>
  <li>
     When  	a passenger is not a &ldquo;no show.&rdquo; A &ldquo;no show&rdquo; is a situation  	when the passenger does not board the flight, or is not available  	for boarding the flight on time, and does not inform the airline  	about the same. 
  </li>
  <li>
    When  	it might be possible for us to secure waivers from the suppliers. 
  </li>
</ul>
<p>All  refund requests go through a process after which it is determined (by  the supplier) whether they&rsquo;re eligible for a refund or not. Once  you make your cancellation request, you will receive an email from us  notifying that your cancellation and refund request has been received  by us. Please be informed that receiving this notification does not  imply that you&rsquo;ll get a refund. This is a type of acknowledgement  of your cancellation and refund request. We also send you a  cancellation reference ID in this email. Using this cancellation  reference ID, you&rsquo;ll be able to track the status of your  cancellation and refund request. After we receive your cancellation  and refund request, the cancellation and refund request would be  forwarded to the supplier/s (airlines, hotels etc.). The decision of  whether you are eligible for a refund or not is taken by the  supplier. Whatever decision they make would be final. We do not have  any say in that. The service fees levied by us on the respective  bookings is non-refundable. </p>
<p>After a refund gets approved by the supplier/s, it may  take a few more days for the amount to be credited to your payment  system (credit card/bank account). A cancellation and refund fee is  usually charged by the supplier while providing a refund to a  customer. The whole cancellation and refund process might take  anywhere between 60 - 90 days. In addition to the suppliers&rsquo;  cancellation and refund fee, we (Travelopick) may also charge a  post-ticketing service fee wherever applicable. The cancellation and  refund fees are levied on the basis of per passenger, per ticket.  This cancellation and refund fee would be levied in instances where a  refund has been granted by the supplier/s. </p>
