            <p>After booking an airline ticket, you may want to withdraw reservation and we understand. Hence, we bring to you the Ticket Withdrawal Security Program to safeguard you of the withdrawal charges.   </p>
			
            <p>As per the Ticket Withdrawal Security Program (TWSP), you are entitled to get a full refund, if the airline policy permits to withdraw your reservation even after 24 hours of booking the airline ticket.</p>
            
            <h4>How does it work?</h4>
			
			<p>We like to keep it simple. </p>
			
			<p>All you have to do is add $18 to the total fare at the payment gateway. Once done, you become a protected traveler with our TWSP. So, if you decide to withdraw reservation after 24 hours of booking the airline ticket, Travelopick will initiate the request to the airline to refund the due amount to you as per the airline authorization.</p>
			
			<p>Enroll with TWSP now and get fully secured! </p>
